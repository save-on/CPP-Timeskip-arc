Journey to max stats in C++
=========================
*timeskip arc, where I exit a proficient systems engineer*
###### The purpose of this repo will be to track the progress of me becoming him. This is where the grind will happen.

## Goal
The goal is to enter the territory of systems level engineering, I would like to learn everything from low level concepts,
systems architecture, design patterns, networking, and automation. On the side I've been super interested in the idea of 
designing and building horror games! :godmode:
